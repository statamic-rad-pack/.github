### Hey there! ğŸ‘‹

This is the very, very beginning of something new. We're assembling a crew that can work independently of the core Statamic team to build and maintain Addons and Starter Kits that serve the community. Think of this as "second-party" â€”Â third-party addons and kits with a first-party gaurentee that they will be built and documented to the core team's standards, well-maintained, and not abandoned.
